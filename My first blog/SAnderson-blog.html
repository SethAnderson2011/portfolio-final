                    </header>
                    <p>Painting miniatures became one of my favorite hobbies because it was a way for me to challenge myself as well as allowing me to be creative while bringing things to life. When I first got started in the hobby I had no idea how intricate it could actually get. I purchased some basic acrylic paint, some small brushes, and a couple of miniatures I thought looked cool. It wasn't until many failed attempts that I finally did some research and discovered things like layering paint, types of brushes, brush strokes, and properly priming the miniature itself to hold the paint better.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Miniatures</h3>
                </header>
                <p>There are many different types of brands, plastics, and models that can be chosen when getting started and choosing what works best for you is important. Knowing brands is important because some companies specialize in making certain model types and if you're looking for something specific and well made it's good to know which company is reliable. Different types of plastics are used and offer different levels of brittleness, flexibility, and heat resistance so knowing how the miniature is going to be handled is key. Choosing the right model is, to me, one of the most important factors. This is because some models can be very intricate in design and attempting to paint a lot of detail in something your aren't interested in can make the hobby not as exciting.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Paints</h3>
                </header>
                <p>For the most part, hobby grade acrylic paint is going to be used when painting miniatures but there are different types that can be used to help add effects. For example, there are metallic tones, washes, high pigment, base paint, contrast, and paint made to help with layering to help build transitioning color effects. Learning techniques and how to add effects make for great stepping stones and has helped make the hobby more interesting because it gives the sense of accomplishment while proving there is always more to improve on.</p>

                    <p>The two main ways to classify acrylic paints is by viscosity and by their grade/quality.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Brushes</h3>
                </header>
                <p>When I first started painting I thought all brushes were made equal. It was a simple design of dipping the brush in paint and adding paint to the model. Once I became aware of the different types it opened the door to painting techniques even more. Shade brushes are designed with a more rounded tip to help apply paint more evenly and quickly. Base brushes are often flat shaped with stiff bristles to push paint into crevices. Layer brushes are rounded like shade brushes but are used for more detailed work. Lastly, dry brushes are specifically made with densely packed bristles and are used after removing most of the paint from the brush before using. Just learning about the different types of brushes made me realize that there was actually technique involved and I couldn't just apply color to an object and have it look good.</p>
